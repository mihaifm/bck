*Bufstop-search*

==============================================================================
1. INTRODUCTION                                            *bufstop-search*

|Bufstop-search| is a plugin for searching in files. It puts bits and pieces
together to make searching a better experience in Vim.

Searching is powered by |ack| , which needs to be installed first.
The plugin provides a |:Bck| command, similar to |:Ack| (see Ack.vim).
The difference is that the results are not displayed in the quickfix window,
but in a special buffer called |Bufstop-search|
Each result has an associated hotkey which triggers the file to be displayed
in the previous window, without leaving the search results. This is similar 
to the |Bufstop| plugin.

In addition, if the *:Bck* command is used without arguments, it makes a 
project-wide search for the word under cursor. 

A project represents the first parent directory that contains a .git folder
inside it (or other project root markers which are obviously configurable). 
This is similar to the |vim-rooter| plugin or the root markers in |CtrlP|.

Some additional commands are provided to enhance the search experience
(see below).

2. INSTALLATION                                   *bufstop-search-installation*

This plugin uses *ack* for the search, which is a Perl script better that
grep. Download and install from http://betterthangrep.com/

To install this plugin just copy *bufstop-search.vim* in the plugin directory
of your vim installation, or install via |pathogen|

2. USAGE                                           *bufstop-usage*

This plugin provides the following commands:

:Bck [options] [{pattern}] [{directory}]                               *:Bck*

Same as |:Ack| but uses the |Bufstop| window instead of the Quickfix window.
Inside it, each result will have an associated hotkey that can be used 
to preview the file that contains it.

If {pattern} is not specified it will make a project-wide search for the word
under cursor (Note: this changes the current working directory in Vim to the
project root. You can use |cd-| to change it back to the previous working
directory after closing the |Bufstop| window).

The following key mappings are present in the |Bufstop| window:

<CR>     Open the selected result. cursorline is used for highlighting
<Esc>    Dismiss the Bufstop window
k,j      Move up/down

:ChangeToRoot                                                  *:ChangeToRoot*

Changes Vim's working directory to the project root directory. Project root
markers are definded by the |g:BufstopSearchRoots| variable.
If you wish to cd back to the previous directory before the change, you can
use the |cd-| command. 

:BufstopSearchOpen                                        *:BufstopSearchOpen*

Open the search results after the window was closed.

:BufstopSearchNext                                        *:BufstopSearchNext*

Go to the next result

:BufstopSearchPrev                                        *:BufstopSearchPrev*

Go to the previous result

==============================================================================
2. CONFIGURATION                                           *bufstop-config*

g:BufstopSearchRoots                                    *g:BufstopSearchRoots*

Defines project root markers used for the |:ChangeToRoot| command. 
Defaults: 
>
   ['.git/', '.git', '_darcs/', '.hg/', '.bzr/', '.svn/', 'Gemfile']

Note: a slash / at the end identifies a directory, no slash means a file.

===============================================================================
4. RECOMMENDED MAPPINGS

You can put these in your |vimrc|, or use totally different mappings:
>
    nmap <F4> :Bck<CR>
    map <leader>q :BufstopSearchOpen<CR>
    map <F7> :BufstopSearchNext<cr>
    map <F8> :BufstopSearchPrev<cr>
